# This program demonstrates how lists work

# For lists, we use square brackets
# Items in lists are separated by commas
# String needs to have speech marks around it


# To print a list


# To print an individual item from a list, we use
# its index (position in the list)


# To add something to the end of a list, use append()


# To add something in a specific position, use insert()


# Lists are mutable (changeable)
# To change the value of an item in a list, we just
# over-write it


# len(list) returns the number of items in a list


# There are two ways we can loop through a list to
# print out the items

# 1. a simple for loop with no range


# 2. Use range() to get numbered list
# Use len(list) to get how many times to loop
